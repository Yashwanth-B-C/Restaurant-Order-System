Restaurant Order System
This is a basic front-end web application designed to simulate a restaurant order management experience. It allows users to select dishes, assign them to tables, and view the orders. This project was developed primarily to practice and showcase fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, focusing on basic DOM manipulation and event handling.
